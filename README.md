## Goal of the project
The goal of this project was to implement a k-nearest neighbor algorithm for the Zalando Fashion MNIST dataset. 

We successfully completed this goal, even going further and implementing the same for the Handwritten Digits MNIST dataset for verification. Furthermore we implemented a vgg-model based convolutional neural network for the Fashion MNIST dataset. 

## Structure of the repository
This repository is structured into folders:
- The **functions** Folder comprises .py files, where the important functions for the PCA and the KNN are stored. 
- The **proposal** Folder comprises all files important for the project proposal. 
- The **Report** Folder comprises the **Plots** folder, where all plots are stored that are included in the Report itself. 
- The **Results** Folder comprises all results stored in a .csv format as well as the folders with the trained algorithm data. 

## Required downloads
Since GitHub limits the size of uploads, you need to install the following files to "topic01_team04":
- fashion-mnist_train.csv
- mnist_train.csv
